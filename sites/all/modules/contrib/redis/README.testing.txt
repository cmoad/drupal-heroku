Redis module testing
====================

Unit tests won't cover the cache backend until the 8.x series.

This won't be fixed, by design. Drupal 8.x now ships a complete cache backend
unit tests suite which will be used when this module will be upgraded.

7.x testing
===========

7.x testing will keep it to the bare minimum and will test some minor bugs such
as admin UI or autoloading related bugs.
